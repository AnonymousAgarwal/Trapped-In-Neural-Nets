Welcome to Week 4! Here we'll try to implement everything we have learnt so far.
The assignment has been broken up in various functions and some part is already coded up for you.
There are comments in every function to guide you.
In this assignment we'll perform image clssification on MNIST dataset.
We have uploaded the dataset as well. Download it and keep it in the same directory as the jupyter notebook.
